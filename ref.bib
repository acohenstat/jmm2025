abstract="Proteomic patterns can help the diagnosis of the underlying pathological state of an organ such as the ovary, the lung, and the breast, to name a few. An accurate classification of mass spectrometry is a crucial point to establish a reliable diagnosis and decision process regarding the type of cancer. A statistical methodology for classifying mass spectrometry data is proposed. An overview of wavelets, principal component analysis-T2 statistic, and support vector machines is given. The study is performed on low-mass SELDI spectra derived from patients with breast cancer and from normal controls. There are 156 samples where control (normal) patients contribute with 57 samples and 99 samples are cancer. A hyperparameter optimization is conducted to select a support vector machine classification model based on grid search. The performance was evaluated with a k-fold cross validation technique and Monte-Carlo simulation with 100 replications. The average accuracy is 100{\%} with standard error equals to 0. The averages of the sensitivity and specificity are both equal to 100{\%}, as well as the area under the curve. The excellent performance of our proposed method is mainly due to the statistical modeling and the feature extraction procedure proposed.",

    abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput and high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments are increasingly used for disease classification and therapeutic guidance. However, the analysis of immense amount of data poses considerable challenges. We have therefore developed a novel method for dimensionality reduction and tested on a published ovarian high-resolution SELDI-TOF dataset.Results: We have developed a four-step strategy for data preprocessing based on: (1) binning, (2) Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, (3) restriction of coefficient of variation and (4) wavelet analysis. Subsequently, support vector machines were used for classification. The developed method achieves an average sensitivity of 97.38\% (sd = 0.0125) and an average specificity of 93.30\% (sd = 0.0174) in 1000 independent k-fold cross-validations, where k = 2, …, 10.Availability: The software is available for academic and non-commercial institutions.Contact:  zlatko.trajanoski@tugraz.at},
